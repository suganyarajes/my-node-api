# Node.js File System Task

This repository contains the implementation of a Node.js server that provides API endpoints to manage text files in a specified folder. The task involves creating an Express.js server to handle HTTP requests, interacting with the file system module in Node.js to create and retrieve text files, and documenting the API endpoints using Postman.

## Task Description

The task involves creating two API endpoints:

1. **Create File Endpoint**: This endpoint creates a text file in a specified folder with the content being the current timestamp. The filename should follow the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.txt`.

2. **Retrieve Files Endpoint**: This endpoint retrieves all the text files in the specified folder and returns their filenames as a JSON array.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment
- Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js
- File System (fs) module: Node.js module for interacting with the file system
- Postman: API development and testing tool

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Install nodemon globally to automatically restart the server: `npm install -g nodemon`.
4. Start the server using `npm start`.
5. Use tools like Postman to test the API endpoints.

## Dependencies

- express: Web framework for Node.js
- body-parser: Middleware for parsing JSON and URL-encoded data in requests

## API Documentation

API documentation is provided using Postman's documentation feature. You can find the API documentation by following this [link](<insert documentation link here>).

## Task Completion

- The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
- API endpoints are implemented as per the task requirements.
- API documentation is provided for easy understanding and testing.

## Credits

This task is part of a learning exercise and was completed by "SUGANYA". Feel free to use and modify the code for your own projects.
